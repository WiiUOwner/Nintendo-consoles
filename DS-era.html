    <h1>The DS</h1>
    <h2>The DS and DS Lite </h2>
    <p>The DS and DS Lite were released in 2004 and 2006 respectively. The DS sold for $149.99 in 2004 dollars ($243.78 2023 dollars), while the DS Lite sold for $129.99 ($197.97 2023 dollars). The DS had single-player GBA support, along with DS single and multiplayer (if the game supports it) via wireless communication with someone who has the same game or by using DS Download Play. There is also PictoChat, a local messaging service using text or drawing via the DS's lower screen being a touch screen. The DS Lite is  a more condensed version of the DS, and has the ability to change the screen brightness, with the drawback of GBA games sticking out of Slot 2 (the GBA game slot). Its battery life was 15-19 hours on its lowest battery setting. There are also option paks and extentions which one would plug in into the GBA slot. </p>
